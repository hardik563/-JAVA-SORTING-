This repository serves as a practical showcase of my journey in understanding and implementing core sorting algorithms in Java. 
Through hands-on coding, I've gained a deeper appreciation for the mechanics and efficiency differences between various sorting paradigms.

Bubble Sort: Implemented this foundational algorithm to grasp the concept of repeated comparisons and swaps. 
While highly intuitive, its O(n 2) average and worst-case time complexity make it impractical for large datasets, primarily serving educational purposes.

Selection Sort: This is a regular sentence. 
Explored this in-place comparison sort, focusing on how it consistently finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning. 
Similar to Bubble Sort, it has an O(n 2) time complexity but performs fewer swaps.

Insertion Sort: Delved into this simple yet effective algorithm, particularly useful for small datasets or nearly sorted data. Its adaptive nature and O(n) best-case time complexity make it a valuable tool in certain scenarios, despite its O(n 2) worst-case performance.

Counting Sort: Practiced this non-comparison-based sorting algorithm, which is highly efficient for sorting elements within a specific range. 
It works by counting the number of occurrences of each distinct element and then using that information to place the elements in their correct sorted positions. It boasts an O(n+k) time complexity (where k is the range of input values), making it extremely fast for appropriate datasets, but it requires additional space.

Inbuilt Sorting (Arrays.sort()): Investigated and leveraged Java's highly optimized Arrays.sort() method.

This involved understanding that behind the scenes, Java employs sophisticated algorithms (like Timsort for objects and dual-pivot quicksort for primitives) that offer average-case O(nlogn) time complexity, demonstrating the power of library functions for efficient sorting.
Each implementation includes clear comments and potential test cases to demonstrate functionality.
